# The Hexagons
## *Assignment from week 5 of SuperHi's Introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript course*
Although they’re a fictional band, The Hexagaons have a website that will rival most of today’s biggest artists! This week’s project has been designed by London based graphic and digital designer Meara Withe (website and Twitter). You’ll hopefully already recognise her work from week 3 Lola’s project, so you’re in store again for another explosively colourful and heavily graphic visual treat.

The real challenge here is how to achieve the menu effect with a centered logo between two navigation sections. Give it your best shot, but if you get stuck the solution is here. Oh, and try your best to use flexbox for things like the header and album elements.

There’s also the same JavaScript effects used to filter the products, which can pretty much be borrowed over from Essmei.
