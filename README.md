# The Hexagons

This project is an assignment from week 5 of [SuperHi's Introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript](superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation) course. The following is a description of the assignment from their site:

>Although they’re a fictional band, The Hexagaons have a website that will rival most of today’s biggest artists! This week’s project has been designed by London based graphic and digital designer Meara Withe ([website](http://www.mearawithe.com/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mearawithe)). You’ll hopefully already recognise her work from week 3 Lola’s project, so you’re in store again for another explosively colourful and heavily graphic visual treat.
